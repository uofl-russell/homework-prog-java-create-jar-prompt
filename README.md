# Persona Statement
As a Java instructor I need to ensure that you know how to create Jar files.

#Acceptance Criteria
-   Create a Java program with a Main class containing a main method that prints "Java Is Really Awesome!" using the System.out.println method.
-   Build this program into a Jar file type artifact with the name Test.jar
-   Upload the Test.jar file into the same directory as this README File.

This is a very simple assignment.  There are only a few tests for this assignment and they are listed below.
-  Verify a file named Test.jar has been added to the base directory (same as this README)
-  The command java -jar Test.jar will run the program and verify it prints the statement "Java Is Really Awesome!".
